This is a simple generic type library for C, loosely modelled on Python.
The fundamental types supported are "None", arrays, dictionaries 
(string-keyed lookups), strings and integers. Types may be nested inside
multi-valued types; e.g. arrays may contain other arrays as an element, 
dictionaries may contain dictionaries of arrays, etc. The library also
supports iteration over arrays and dictionaries.
